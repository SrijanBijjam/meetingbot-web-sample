# Zoom Meeting Bot Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and configure the Zoom Meeting SDK Bot sample application.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- A Zoom account with Meeting SDK credentials
- Chrome/Chromium browser (for Puppeteer)

## Step 1: Installation

The dependencies are already installed. If you need to reinstall them:

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 2: Get Your Zoom Meeting SDK Credentials

1. Go to the [Zoom Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/)
2. Sign in with your Zoom account
3. Click "Develop" â†’ "Build App"
4. Choose "Meeting SDK" and fill out the required information
5. Once approved, you'll get:
   - **SDK Key** (Client ID)
   - **SDK Secret** (Client Secret)

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Edit the `.env` file and add your Zoom credentials:

```bash
# Zoom Meeting SDK Credentials: 
ZOOM_MSDK_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_SDK_KEY_HERE
ZOOM_MSDK_SECRET=YOUR_ACTUAL_SDK_SECRET_HERE

# Optional: If you need Server-to-Server OAuth
ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID
CLIENT_ID=YOUR_ZOOM_CLIENT_ID
CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET
```

## Step 4: Configure Frontend Variables

Edit `frontend/client-view.js` and update these variables:

```javascript
// Required: Your Zoom Meeting SDK Key (same as in .env)
var sdkKey = "YOUR_ACTUAL_SDK_KEY_HERE";

// Required: Zoom Meeting number you want the bot to join
var meetingNumber = "123456789";

// Optional: Meeting password (if required)
var passWord = "";

// Required: User name for the bot
var userName = "Web Bot";

// Optional: User email (required for webinars)
var userEmail = "";

// Leave these endpoints as they are (they're correctly configured):
var authEndpoint = "http://localhost:30015/api/zoom/msig";
var zakEndpoint = "http://localhost:30015/api/zoom/hzak";
var meetingDetailsEndpoint = "http://localhost:30015/api/zoom/mnum";
var leaveUrl = "https://zoom.us";
```

## Step 5: Test Your Setup

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:30015`

3. The frontend should load and display a "Join Meeting" button

## Step 6: Run the Bot

1. Make sure your server is running (`npm run start`)

2. In a separate terminal, you can run the bot script:
   ```bash
   node backend/helpers/meetingBot.js
   ```

The bot will:
- Open a headless browser
- Navigate to your frontend
- Automatically click the join meeting button
- Join the specified Zoom meeting
- Request recording permission

## Configuration Tips

### For Different Meeting Numbers
- Update `meetingNumber` in `frontend/client-view.js`
- Or modify the code to accept meeting numbers dynamically

### For Host Role
- Change `role` from `0` to `1` in `frontend/client-view.js`
- You'll need a ZAK token for host functionality

### For Scheduled Bot Runs
- Use the cron examples in `backend/helpers/meetingBot.js`
- Or set up system-level cron jobs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"SDK Key not found" error**
   - Make sure your `.env` file has the correct ZOOM_MSDK_KEY
   - Ensure the sdkKey in `client-view.js` matches your actual SDK key

2. **Meeting join fails**
   - Verify the meeting number is correct
   - Check if the meeting requires a password
   - Ensure the meeting is active/scheduled

3. **Recording permission denied**
   - The meeting host must allow participants to record
   - Some meeting types don't allow participant recording

4. **Browser doesn't start**
   - Make sure Puppeteer installed correctly
   - On macOS, you might need to allow Chrome to run

### Debug Mode

To run the bot in non-headless mode for debugging:

Edit `backend/helpers/meetingBot.js`:
```javascript
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  headless: false,  // Change to false for debugging
  args: ["--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream"],
});
```

## Security Notes

- Never commit your actual SDK keys to version control
- Keep your `.env` file secure
- The SDK secret should only be used server-side
- Consider using environment variables in production

## Next Steps

- Customize the bot behavior in `frontend/client-view.js`
- Add scheduling functionality using cron
- Implement webhook handling for meeting events
- Add logging and error handling for production use
